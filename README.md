# Backlog

Backlog is a program designed to help users track video games they want to play or complete in the future.

---

## To-Do List

- [ ] **Add a video game entry**
  - Users can add a video game title to their backlog along with a comment about the game.
  - Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for game entries.
- [ ] **Track game completion**
  - Users can move a game from their backlog to their completed section or to a dropped section.
  - A game can be placed in completed, backlog, or dropped.
  - Users can permanently remove a game from either section.
- [ ] **AI game recommendations**
  - Once a user has a minimum number of games in their backlog or completed list, enable a feature to ask AI for game recommendations.

> **Note:** This to-do list is not exhaustive and may include additional features in the future.
